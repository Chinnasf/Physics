    "We will use a dense neural network in Keras to solve a simple regression problem. \n",
    "## Learning Task\n",
    "We will construct a dense neural network to **predict the invariant mass of a particle** from its energy, momentum, (and charge).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that this task does not require machine learning. We choose a task with a known mapping to help us create, debug, and tune our first neural network.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "This dataset is a collection of simulated particle events from [Pythia](http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html). The dataset is a 2D array where each row represents one event from an $e^{-} + p$ (electron-proton) collision. This dataset is comprised _only_ of events where exactly 16 particles are produced from an electron-proton collision. Each particle contains $(p_x,p_y,p_z,E,q)$. Each event is therefore represented by 80 numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced activity:** There are more interesting event-wise learning tasks using this dataset. Consider crafting your own learning task and target for this data.\n",

    "## Computational Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is your first time in a Jupyter-like environment, please read the following carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    " - You are in an active kernel\n",
    " - Run each cell with `Shift + Enter`\n",
    " - You must execute the cells in the order that you want the code to run\n",
    " - In Colab, `Runtime`$\\rightarrow$`Change runtime type` allows you to utilize GPUs and TPUs. They are unnecessary here, but will become vital in later exercises.\n"
