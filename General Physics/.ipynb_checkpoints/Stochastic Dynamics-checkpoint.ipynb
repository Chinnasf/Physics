    "A way to define a random variable is through a probability distribution $P(x)$ -- the probability of observing the variable $x$. In other words, the probability distribution contains all the information to charactertize a random variable. Nevertheless, in many real-world scenarions, it is impossible to have an explicit expresion for $P(x)$. Other important quantities to characterize a random variable are the average and the standard deviation. \n",
